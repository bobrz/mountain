Mountain Project  


A simple page that's show all the trekkings area availiable in Serra da Mantiqueira in Brazil's southern.

All the maps are just simple maps made with Google My Maps. Don't have nothing with a complex code. Just HTML/CSS and basic JS.

The main idea, of this project is to show all the tracks can be founded on Serra da Mantiqueira. Famous to have the most difficult trekking of the country. The Serra Fina Trekking! The Pedra da Mina is the 4th higher summit on Brazil. 

Many of the trekkers that have intention to ascend this group of mountains, have some troubles to find informations, like places to stay, guides, transport. Even for people that wants to pay for a guide, it's important to have a place (web-site) that provides information about the routes, testimonials from this places, climates information and other utilities.

In other hand, throught this web-site, we can conect our users with the local people and his services. 

For those that wants to help, a huge help would be a translation of all the content to english or Spanish. If you are learning Portuguese, it's a good chance to help and improve!

This web site don't have the intention to be a travel adventure agency! Thefore, it's completely non-profit.

Today the project progress to finish the first part are about 60%.
