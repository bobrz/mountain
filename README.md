Mountain Project  


A simple page that's show all the trekkings area availiable in Serra da Mantiqueira in Brazil's southern.

All the maps are just simple maps made with Google My Maps. Don't have nothing with a complex code. Just HTML/CSS and basic JS.

The main idea is just to show all the most important trekkings of area. This region of the country is knowledged to have great mountains to practice trekking. And many of the canditates that have intention to ascend this mountains, have a big problem to find good informations to do that.  With hard mountains to trekking this place is like a trainning area for those wants to ascend Patagonia or even the Aconc√°gua Summit.



For those that wants to help, a huge help would be a translation of all the content to english or Spanish. If you are learning Portuguese, it's a good chance to help and improve!


This web site don't have the intention to be a travel adventure agency! Whoever it's completely non-profit.

Today the progress to finish the first part are about 60%.
